# Oracle Functions Lab

In this lab you will explore serverless computing using Oracle Functions.

## Oracle Functions and Fn

Oracle Functions is built on the open source Fn Project and so much of the
development experience is exactly the same so any experience you have with Fn
will be 100% applicable. The key differences are that Oracle Functions is a
managed service so there's no need to start and manage an Fn server (it's truly
serverless!) and being a cloud service Oracle Functions is integrated with the
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management (IAM),
Networking, Events and other services.

## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to setup your functions development environment
and then guide you through a series of labs focusing on different topics
including:

1. Function Basics
2. Java Functions and Unit testing
3. Troubleshooting Functions
4. Automatically invoking functions with OCI Events service
5. Functions clients including the OCI SDK
6. Calling functions using oci-curl
7. Customizing the function execution environment

Step one is getting your environment setup.
